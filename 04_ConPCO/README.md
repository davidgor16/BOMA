# ConPCO: Preserving Phoneme Characteristics For Automatic Pronunciation Assessment Leveraging Contrastive Ordinal Regularization

This is the codebase of the paper [ConPCO: Preserving Phoneme Characteristics For Automatic Pronunciation Assessment Leveraging Contrastive Ordinal Regularization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10890778), which is published at IEEE ICASSP 2025.

> We appreciate [GOPT](https://github.com/YuanGongND/gopt) (Gong et al., 2022) who provides a great template and code work. We follow their design and modify it as our edition.

> We also appreciate [SpeechOcean762](https://github.com/jimbozhang/speechocean762) (Junbo et al., 2021) and [gop-ft](https://github.com/JazminVidal/gop-ft) (Marcelo et al., 2022) who provides the sample codes on GOP implementation in Python codebase with PyKaldi APIs.

> We also apprecitate [EPSNet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet) (Watanabe et al., 2018) provide the implementation of multi-head attention module.

> Finally, we appreciate the implementatoin of [ordinal entropy](https://github.com/needylove/OrdinalEntropy) (Shihao et al., 2023).

In this work, we propose ConPCO, a contrastive phonemic ordinal regularizer tailored for regression-based pronunciation assessment models. The proposed regularizer generates more phoneme-discriminative features by considering the ordinal relationships among regression targets.
ConPCO first aligns phoneme representations of an APA model with textual embeddings of phonetic transcriptions via contrastive learning. Afterward, it retains phoneme characteristics by regulating distances between inter- and intra-phoneme categories in the feature space, while allowing for ordinal relationships among the output targets (phone-level accuracy).

## Dataset
SpeechOcean762 (licenced with CC BY 4.0), an open source dataset is used in this work. Please download it from [https://www.openslr.org/101](https://www.openslr.org/101).

## Data
In this work, we utilize the following features:

 - GOP (Goodness-of-Pronunciation) Features
 - Energy Features
 - Duration Features
 - Self-Supervised Learning Audio Features (e.g., Wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM) Features
 - Word IDs Features

## Demo

We refer what had done in the [gop_speechocean762](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi/tree/master/egs/gop_speechocean762) (Junbo et al., 2021) reciepe in Kaldi and [gop-ft](https://github.com/JazminVidal/gop-ft) (Marcelo et al., 2022), utilizing PyKaldi (Can et al., 2018) modules to help implement the process of obtaining GOP features, imitating how `compute-gop` is done. This helps us eliminate the bottleneck on computing time of the whole process to obtain GOP features.
